# Session Leader Information
Dr. Julian Kunkel, juliankunkel@googlemail.com, University of Reading
# Professional title: Lecturer
## BIO
Dr. Kunkel started in 2018 as Lecturer at the CS department of the Unversity of Reading.
Previously, he was a postdoc in the research department of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) that partners with the Scientific Computing group at the Universit√§t Hamburg.
There, he managed several research projects revolving around HPC and particularly HPC storage.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage in 2003, during his studies of computer science.

Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and software engineering of scientific software.

# Abstract (Max 250 words)
Evolving and new storage technologies introduced over the last few years are causing increasing complexity for HPC data management. Hence, analyzing, comparing, or even predicting performance of different HPC machines and storage systems has become more complicated. To address this challenge, the community has developed a new composite benchmark that has lead to the creation of the competitive IO-500 list. The IO-500 benchmark consists of several data and metadata benchmarks to identify performance boundaries for optimized and suboptimal applications. In addition to offering different ways to compare storage systems, the list collects detailed information about storage system design to help system designers make informed trade-offs when specifying new storage requirements. While the initial list contains only 9 systems, we expect a rapid growth in the second list.

The development of the benchmark has been powered by the Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org), which provides a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information, fosters international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O, and tracks the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems. VI4IO provides a comprehensive data from sites, supercomputers and storage. This enables an in-depth analysis of various system characteristics.

The general purpose of this BoF is to foster the storage community in understanding the performance characteristics of HPC storage. The session leaders will give a series of talks followed by Q&A:
1) The IO-500 approach is presented; this includes the release of the 2nd IO-500 list and providing highlights and insight.
2) The virtual institute and the comprehensive data center list is introduced.

Around the two presentations, we organize feedback sessions with the attendees.
The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of these community efforts.

# Description of approach to make the BoF interactive

Of the 60-minute session, the presentations will cover about 35 minutes.
Between the talks we have time for Q&A, then we discuss with the attendees the roadmaps and feature requests. After the first presentation, we additionally encourage attendees to provide feedback about the execution of the benchmark. We will also quickly demonstrate how to setup and run the benchmark with a Q&A. After the second presentation, we will also conduct some surveys in the room in respect to issues in analyzing performance, reception of the benchmark, the need for standards and more.


# Targeted Audience (max 100 words)

I/O experts from data centers and industry.
Researchers/Engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers.
Interested domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.
