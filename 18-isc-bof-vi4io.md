# Title
The Virtual Institute of I/O and the IO-500

# Session Leader Information
Dr. Julian Kunkel, juliankunkel@googlemail.com, University of Reading
# Professional title: Lecturer
## BIO
Dr. Kunkel started in 2018 as Lecturer at the CS department of the Unversity of Reading.
Previously, he was a postdoc in the research department of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) that partners with the Scientific Computing group at the Universit√§t Hamburg.
There, he managed several research projects revolving around HPC and particularly HPC storage.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage in 2003, during his studies of computer science.

Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and software engineering of scientific software.

# Abstract (Max 250 words)

Due to the increasing complexity of HPC data management, activities in the storage research community have increased over the last few years.  
The general purpose of this BoF is to foster this community.

An important activity is the community driven development of an IO-500 benchmark.
The speakers will introduce the international Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org) and focus on the status of the IO-500 development.
A highlight is the presentation of the first IO-500 list at SC.
The direction of VI4IO and the standardization of the IO-500 is then discussed with the participants.


Goals of the BoF are to 1) advertise the community hub but also discuss and steer the direction of the community effort; 2) to reveal the inagural IO-500 list;
3) to discuss the benefit and direction of the efforts with the community.

Goals of the Virtual Institute for I/O are:
* Provide a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information
* Foster international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O
* Track, and encourage, the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems

The IO-500 benchmark consists of data and metadata benchmarks to identify performance boundaries for optimized and suboptimal applications.
Together with comprehensive data from sites, supercomputers and storage, in-depth analysis of system characteristics are tracked by the list and can be analyzed.
We have run the benchmark on several sites and reveal the first list during supercomputing.

Expected HPC audience are 1) I/O experts from data centers and industry, 2) researchers/engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers, 3) domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.

The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of the community effort.
