# Title
The Virtual Institute of I/O and the IO-500

# Session Leader Information
Dr. Julian Kunkel, kunkel@dkrz.de, DKRZ, +49 40 460094 161
## BIO
Dr. Julian Kunkel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Computing group at the German Climate Computing Center and the Universit√§t Hamburg.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage during his studies of computer science in 2003.
Since then, he researches methods to improve efficiency of storage systems in general.
Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and  software engineering of scientific software.

# BOF Topic Area
Data Analytics, Visualization & Storage

# Abstract (Max 100 words)
## Provide a short description of your proposed BOF, clearly stating its goal(s), topic, format, and intended audience. If your BOF is accepted, this information will be used in the program. Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.

Due to the increasing complexity of HPC data management, activities in the storage research community have increased over the last few years.  
The general purpose of this BoF is to foster this community. 

An important activity is the community driven development of an IO-500 benchmark.
The speakers will introduce the international Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org) and focus on the status of the IO-500 development.
A highlight is the presentation of the first IO-500 list at SC.
The direction of VI4IO and the standardization of the IO-500 is then discussed with the participants.


# Long Description (Maximum 500 words)
## Provide a description of your proposed BOF, clearly stating its goal(s), topic, relevance to the expected HPC audience, whether the BOF has been held before and past attendance count(s), and the outcome (e.g., written report describing results of survey of BOF attendees for a specific question - be sure to indicate which survey questions will be asked). Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.  [Note: BOF Meetings - please enter "N/A"]

Goals of the BoF are to 1) advertise the community hub but also discuss and steer the direction of the community effort; 2) to reveal the inagural IO-500 list;
3) to discuss the benefit and direction of the efforts with the community.

Goals of the Virtual Institute for I/O are:
* Provide a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information
* Foster international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O
* Track, and encourage, the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems

The IO-500 benchmark consists of data and metadata benchmarks to identify performance boundaries for optimized and suboptimal applications.
Together with comprehensive data from sites, supercomputers and storage, in-depth analysis of system characteristics are tracked by the list and can be analyzed.
We have run the benchmark on several sites and reveal the first list during supercomputing.

Expected HPC audience are 1) I/O experts from data centers and industry, 2) researchers/engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers, 3) domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.

The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of the community effort.


# Session Format
## How much of the session will be used for interaction between audience and session leaders/presenters?
25%

## What is the primary format for content that does not directly involve audience discussion?
Sequence of presentations

## Does the BOF topic deal with commercial technology?
Not commercial

#Description of the session format (Maximum 150 words)
## Provide a short description on how you plan to organize the BOF session, to justify, clarify and expand on your selections in the "Session format" pa of the submission. In your response, keep in mind the guidelines from the Call for BOFs about what is appropriate for an SC BOF.  [Note: BOF Meetings, please enter "N/A"]

The session leaders will give a series of talks followed by Q&A and audience discussion.
Talk 1) An introductory presentation about the virtual institute including the  community hub including the high-performance storage list is given.
Talk 2) The status of the IO-500 is given, illustrating the current approach, elaborating on the difficulties of I/O benchmarking.
Talk 3) The first IO-500 list is revealed together with highlights and insight provided.
