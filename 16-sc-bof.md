## Julian Kunkel, kunkel@dkrz.de, DKRZ, +49 40 460094 161
## BIO
Julian Kunkel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Computing group at the Universit√§t Hamburg.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage during his studies of computer science in 2003.
Since then, he researches methods to improve efficiency of storage systems in general.
Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and  software engineering of scientific software.
In 2013, he defended his thesis about monitoring and simulation of parallel programs on application and system level.

## BIO
As Chief Architect for Seagate Government Solutions, John Bent researches and designs storage systems necessary to support an exascale supercomputer. His prior work includes building several burst buffer prototypes while working for EMC and the PLFS virtual file system that achieved orders of magnitude bandwidth improvements for parallel writes to a single file while working for Los Alamos National Lab.

# BOF Topic Area
Data Analytics, Visualization & Storage

# Abstract (Max 100 words)
## Provide a short description of your proposed BOF, clearly stating its goal(s), topic, format, and intended audience. If your BOF is accepted, this information will be used in the program. Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.

Due to the increasing complexity of HPC data management, activities in the storage research community 
have increased over the last few years.  The general purpose of this BoF is to foster this community and discuss 
the role of the international Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org) in supporting, developing, and maintaining this community.  

The speakers will give talks covering VI4IO and issues of benchmarking storage systems.
The direction of these efforts is then discussed with the participants.
A specific purpose of the BoF is to elaborate whether the community would be well-served by an IO-500 benchmark similar to the Top-500. 

# Long Description (Maximum 500 words)
## Provide a description of your proposed BOF, clearly stating its goal(s), topic, relevance to the expected HPC audience, whether the BOF has been held before and past attendance count(s), and the outcome (e.g., written report describing results of survey of BOF attendees for a specific question - be sure to indicate which survey questions will be asked). Indicate paragraph breaks by a blank line in the text field; all other text formatting will be lost.  [Note: BOF Meetings - please enter "N/A"]

Goals of the BoF are to 1) advertise the community hub but also discuss and steer the direction of the community effort, 2) to specifically identify possibilities to create a relevant community I/O benchmark that can be tracked with an IO-500 list.

Goals of the Virtual Institute for I/O are:
* Provide a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information
* Foster international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O
* Track, and encourage, the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems

They are based on the philosophical cornerstones:
* Treat every member and participant equally
* Allow free participation without any membership fee inclusive to all
* Be independent of vendors and research facilities

Expected HPC audience are 1) I/O experts from data centers and industry, 2) researchers/engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers, 3) domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.

The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of the community effort, a short report about the discussions for VI4IO and the IO-500 will be written and published on our community page.

This is the first time, this BoF is held at SC, but during ISC a BoF about VI4IO has been given:
http://www.isc-hpc.com/isc16_ap/sessiondetails.htm?t=session&o=363&a=select
The number of attendees was about 30 people (although the attendee numbers are not comparable to SC).

# Session Format
## How much of the session will be used for interaction between audience and session leaders/presenters?
25%

## What is the primary format for content that does not directly involve audience discussion?
Sequence of presentations

## Does the BOF topic deal with commercial technology?
Not commercial

#Description of the session format (Maximum 150 words)
## Provide a short description on how you plan to organize the BOF session, to justify, clarify and expand on your selections in the "Session format" part of the submission. In your response, keep in mind the guidelines from the Call for BOFs about what is appropriate for an SC BOF.  [Note: BOF Meetings, please enter "N/A"]
