The 4th HPC I/O in the Data Center Workshop (HPC-IODC 2018)
in conjunction with ISC High Performance on Thursday June 28th, 2018, in
Frankfurt, Germany.

** Workshop overview **

Managing scientific data at large scale is challenging for scientists
but also for the host data center. The storage and file systems
deployed within a data center are expected to meet users' requirements
for data integrity and high performance across heterogeneous and
concurrently running applications.

With new storage technologies and layers in the memory hierarchy, the
picture is becoming murkier. To effectively manage the data load
within a data center, I/O experts must understand how users expect to
use these new storage technologies and what services they should
provide in order to enhance user productivity. We seek to ensure a
systems-level perspective is included in these discussions.

In this workshop we bring together I/O experts from data centers and
application workflows to share current practices for scientific
workflows, issues and obstacles for both hardware and the software
stack, and R&D to overcome these issues.

The workshop content is build on two tracks:
1) research paper track – requesting submissions regarding
state-of-the-practice and research about I/O in the datacenter.
2) talks from I/O experts – you'll need to submit a rough outline for your talk.

We will stream the workshop live using YouTube and respond to questions asked in comments.
If you are interested to join please send an email to kunkel@dkrz.de

Contributions to both tracks are peer reviewed and require submission
of the respective research paper or idea for your presentation via
Easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hpciodc2018

The HPC-IODC workshop is embedded into a full-day program
for I/O that we organize with the team of the Workshop on Performance and
Scalability of Storage Sytems (WOPSSS) URL: http://wopsss.org/
We will build a program with a joint morning session with keynote talks and best papers and
then diverge into two independent workshops in the afternoon.

** Track: research papers **

The proceedings of the research papers will be published by Springer in the
Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series.
The research track accepts papers covering state-of-the-practice and research dedicated to storage in the datacenter.
We accept short papers with up to 12 pages (excl. references) in LNCS format.

We will accept more papers in the scope of our topics than can be presented
at full length during the workshop. Therewith, we give authors a chance to
submit relevant papers but not insist on their participation.
Additionally, we can focus on the discussion of controversial topics
during the workshop.

Paper Deadlines
- Submission deadline: 2018-04-12 AoE
- Author notification: 2018-04-25
- Pre-final submission: 2018-06-10 (to be shared during the workshop)
- Workshop: 2018-06-28
- Camera-ready papers: 2018-07-28 (preliminary date)

** Track: Talks by I/O experts **

The topics of interest in this track include but are not limited to:
- A description of the operational aspects of your data center
- A particular solution for certain data center workloads in production
We also accept industry talks, given that they focus on operational issues on data centers and omit marketing.

If you are interested to participate, please submit a short (1/2 page)
abstract of your talk together with a (very) short Bio.

Abstract Deadlines:

- Submission deadline: 2018-04-13 AoE
- Author notification: 2018-04-25
