## BIO
Julian Kunkel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Computing group at the Universit√§t Hamburg.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage during his studies of computer science in 2003.
Since then, he researches methods to improve efficiency of storage systems in general.
Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and  software engineering of scientific software.
In 2013, he defended his thesis about monitoring and simulation of parallel programs on application and system level.

# Abstract (Max 100 words)
Due to the increasing complexity of HPC data management, activities in the storage research community have increased over the last few years.  
The general purpose of this BoF is to foster this community. 

An important activity is the community driven development of an IO-500 benchmark.
The speakers will introduce the international Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org) and focus on the status of the IO-500 development.
A highlight is the presentation of the inaugural IO-500 list at SC.
The direction of VI4IO and the standardization of the IO-500 is then discussed with the participants.

# Long description

Goals of the BoF are to 1) advertise the community hub but also discuss and steer the direction of the community effort; 2) to reveal the inagural IO-500 list;
3) to discuss the benefit and direction of the efforts with the community.

Goals of the Virtual Institute for I/O are:
* Provide a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information
* Foster international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O
* Track, and encourage, the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems

VI4IO provides a resource for storage researchers to both document their systems and discuss best practices.
The IO-500 list offers a way to document relative performance for comparative purposes with a ranking to encourage competitive development and IO optimization for vendors and provides a management justification.
The IO-500 benchmark consists of data and metadata benchmarks to identify performance boundaries for optimized and suboptimal applications.
Together with comprehensive data from sites, supercomputers and storage, in-depth analysis of system characteristics are tracked by the list and can be analyzed in detail.
Tuning of storage is explicitly encouraged by the design of the IO-500 but tuning details are part of the submission process and must be revealed.
Thus, they help defining best practices.
We have run the benchmark on several sites and reveal the first list during supercomputing.



Expected HPC audience are 1) I/O experts from data centers and industry, 2) researchers/engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers, 3) domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.

The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of the community effort.
