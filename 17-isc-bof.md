## BIO
Julian Kunkel is a postdoctoral researcher in the Scientific Computing group at the Universit√§t Hamburg.
Julian gained interest in the topic of HPC storage during his studies of computer science in 2003.
Since then, he researches methods to improve efficiency of storage systems in general.
Besides his main goal to provide efficient and performance-portable I/O, his HPC-related interests are: data reduction techniques, performance analysis of parallel applications and parallel I/O, management of cluster systems, cost-efficiency considerations, and  software engineering of scientific software.
In 2013, he defended his thesis about monitoring and simulation of parallel programs on application and system level.

# Abstract (Max 250 words)

Due to the increasing complexity of HPC data management, activities in the storage research community 
have increased over the last few years.  The general purpose of this BoF is to foster this community and discuss 
the role of the international Virtual Institute for I/O (VI4IO, http://vi4io.org) in supporting, developing, and maintaining this community.

Goals of the Virtual Institute for I/O are:
* Provide a platform for I/O researchers and enthusiasts for exchanging information
* Foster international collaboration in the field of high-performance I/O
* Track, and encourage, the deployment of large storage systems by hosting information about high-performance storage systems

The speakers will give talks covering VI4IO and issues of benchmarking storage systems.
The direction of these efforts is then discussed with the participants.
A specific purpose of the BoF is to elaborate whether the community would be well-served by an IO-500 benchmark similar to the Top-500. 

Goals of the BoF are to 1) advertise the community hub but also discuss and steer the direction of the community effort, 2) to specifically identify possibilities to create a relevant community I/O benchmark that can be tracked with an IO-500 list.

The outcome of this BoF will steer the direction of the community effort, a short report about the discussions for VI4IO and the IO-500 will be written and published on our community page.


# Targeted Audience

Expected HPC audience are 1) I/O experts from data centers and industry, 2) researchers/engineers working on high-performance I/O for data centers, 3) domain scientists and computer scientists interested in discussing I/O issues.

# Expected Attendees
20-50
